## Breast Cancer Classification
![Benign (Non-cancerous) vs Malignant (Cancerous)](https://pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/breast_cancer_classification_header.jpg)

## Overview

This project utilizes **Deep Learning** to classify breast cancer tumors as either **malignant** or **benign**. The objective is to leverage neural networks to assist in early cancer detection and diagnosis, potentially improving outcomes for patients.



Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers globally. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This project employs a **Deep Learning model** to analyze the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)** dataset, a benchmark dataset for breast cancer classification.



## Motivation
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers, and early diagnosis is critical. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing an accurate and efficient diagnostic tool based on neural networks.




## Technical Aspect

Training Deep Learning Models:

We train Deep learning algorithms(ANN) on the Breast Cancer.
All models are implemented using TensorFlow with Keras , a Python library for Deep leaning.




## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

# To clone the repository

```bash

gh repo clone Creator-Turbo/Breast-Cancer

```
# Install dependencies: (all lib)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

## To Do

1 . Add more advanced architectures (e.g., CNNs).<br>
2 . Explore hyperparameter tuning.<br>
3 . Improve deployment instructions. <br
4 .  Deploy the model as a Flask app.<br>
5 . Create an end-to-end project with a user-friendly interface for predictions.<br>
